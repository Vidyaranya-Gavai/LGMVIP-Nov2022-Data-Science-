# Task-4: Image to pencil sketch with python

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to grayscale image.
This will turn the image into classic black and white photo. Then the next
thing to do is invert the grascale image also called as negative image, this 
will be our inverted grayscale image. Then we can finally create the pencil 
sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image.
